OT Jobs are an easy way to make the Zerynth agents interact with PLCs using the Zerynth Cloud. OT Jobs are functions that are triggered from the Zerynth cloud and executed on the respective device, which will write the received value on the target register of the PLC that it is controlling. From the operatorâ€™s point of view, you can manage PLCs at scale, while issuing jobs and executing functions in a schedulable manner for a large fleet of devices.
On the Zerynth Cloud side, the interface is pretty simple and adjustable.
